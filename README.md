This application demonstrates the use of **Contextual Cards** (_not a coined term_) which basically refers any view that is rendered using response fetched from an API. These views
are dynamic and hence their properties like _color_, _texts_, _buttons_ and _actions_ etc. can be changed from back-end at anytime.
<br />
This project has been developed for an assignment given by the FamPay team.
